## Features

- **Piece Movement**: Move pieces left, right, and down using arrow keys.
- **Piece Rotation**: Rotate pieces using the up arrow key.
- **Line Clearing**: Automatically clears full lines and updates the score.
- **Game Over**: Displays a "Game Over" screen with the final score and a button to restart the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.
